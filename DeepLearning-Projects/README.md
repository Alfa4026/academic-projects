# 🤖 Deep Learning Projects

Hi there! 👋

This is the main directory for all my academic projects related to Deep Learning. This folder acts as a "table of contents" for the various assignments and experiments I've worked on for my course.

Each project is contained within its own folder and includes a detailed `README.md` file explaining the specifics.

## 📂 Project List

### 1. 🖼️ Midterm Exam Project: Image Classification (CNN vs. ResNet-18)

* **Topic:** Building a custom CNN from scratch and comparing its performance against a modified ResNet-18 architecture for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
* **Folder:** `MidExam-Project/`
* **👉 [Check out the full details & results here](MidExam-Project/README.md)**

### 2. 🧠 Final Exam Project: Sequence Denoising (RNN vs. LSTM vs. Attention)

* **Topic:** Analyzing the ability of RNN, LSTM, and LSTM-Attention models to "remember" an original sequence of numbers while ignoring randomly inserted noise (blank tokens).
* **Folder:** `FinalExam-Project/`
* **👉 [Check out the full details & results here](FinalExam-Project/README.md)**
